# Code Testing Repository

Welcome to the **Code Testing Repository**! This repository is dedicated to experimenting, testing, and showcasing code examples for multiple programming languages. Here, I will be exploring various coding concepts, algorithms, and testing methodologies in **Python**, **Java**, **PHP**, **JavaScript**, and other languages.

## Project Overview

This repository contains testing scripts and projects in the following languages:

- **Python**: Scripts to test algorithms, libraries, and data processing.
- **Java**: Java testing including unit tests, functional programming, and object-oriented examples.
- **PHP**: Server-side scripting, web application development, and testing using PHPUnit.
- **JavaScript**: Frontend and backend (Node.js) testing, including asynchronous programming and API interaction.
- **Other languages**: I occasionally explore code testing in additional languages as needed.

## Structure

Each language has its own folder for better organization:
```bash
├── Python/
│   ├── test_cases/
│   ├── scripts/
├── Java/
│   ├── src/
│   ├── tests/
├── PHP/
│   ├── web_tests/
│   ├── cli_tests/
├── JavaScript/

└── README.md
